# flipcard_product_review_web_srapping_flask_app
Hello Everyone,
I have developed a project “flipcart_product_review_and_image_scrapping_App”. It is a web scraping project which scraps purchased product review data from the flip cart website and fills it in CSV files . User should be Ragister and login this app then it scrapping the data. And also User data and its search History store in SQL database.

What exactly does it do?

· The project scraps the Purchased Product Reviews data available on the Flipcart website.
· It will show top 10 review in web app.
· It creates a separate CSV file per searched product are saved in that CSV fole, with each CSV file can be download.
· The Images also scrap from google and its store in image dorectory.
· Each User data and its searched history will store in SQL datbase.

Tech stack: Flask Framework

My learnings:

· Learned about the functionality of Flask and python library's urllib.request,BeautifulSoup,requests which applicability in web scraping.
· Used python mysql.connector,render_template,request,jsonify,redirect,session module. Though it is fully deprecated now, as a beginner, it gives a brief understanding of how HTTP calls are made.
· Gained an understanding of how we can scrap data from website and its store in csv files operate and their use in data transmission.
. Built a REST API for interacting with resources using Python Flask
. Designed the frontend using HTML/CSS
. Implemented a login/signup functionality with support session login
. Custom error pages for when things go wrong

Also, for visual aid, I am including a project video to help illustrate the functionality of the project.
